 I don't see why one would decide to run this,
 but better safe than sorry                   

!!^!!WARNING!^!WARNING!^!WARNING!^!WARNING!!^!!


To run the tester, place assignment1.cpp into the directory and run
	make;
	./driver

The tester will run your instances of your solution with the input files
in the Inputs/ directory and output from your program will be stored in the OutPuts/ directory

The files used to determine if your outputs 
 are correct  are in the ExpectedOutputs/ directory
 and editing these files might make the tester 
 evaluate incorrectly
